Autoshift turnoff using default setting.
Oneshot key on Left Shift.
Tried using dynamic macro but I can't get it to run.
Has a default RGB mode when Capslock on and own RGB mode when off.

FYI: This is my first custom keyboard, my first time using Github and my first time doing things using dos like interface. I don't know sh!t about coding and English is not my native language.
